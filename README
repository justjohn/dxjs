dx.js provides a set of classes for conditionally styling based on mobile browser.

USAGE:

The following classes are provided based on the browser:

* dx-android
* dx-iphone
* dx-ipad
* dx-ios
* dx-mobile
* dx-desktop

From an html document you can then customize the styling of an element per platform.
For example, if you have the following in your html:

<div class="message">Join the dark side. We have cookies.</div>

You can style it based on platform like this:

.dx-android .message {
    display:none;
}
.dx-ios .message {
    color:red;
}

In this example the message is hidden from android users and red on ios devices.
